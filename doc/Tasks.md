#### How to enter new tasks?
Assume a task prototype has the name of Awesome Task (such as Fragment Construction). To enter new tasks and track all existing tasks progress and information, go to Tasks > Awesome Tasks. You can click the button New Awesome Task to enter inputs for new tasks: you can enter anything that helps you recognize in the Name field, leave the Status as waiting by default, enter the rest of arguments referring to the **input requirements** of each specific task documentation in the following sections. If an argument input has "+", "-" buttons, it means the argument takes an array of inputs, if the input has two "+", "-" button, it means the argument takes an array of array inputs. You can also click the status bar such as waiting, ready, canceled, etc to track all your tasks. You can use search bar to filter out your tasks of interest by typing user name or tasks name. It starts with your user name as default. You can check your input by running aqualib/workflows/general/tasks_inputs.rb, enter Awesome Task as the argument in task_name and enter your user name in the group argument. After you run, you can check the notifications of the tasks to see what's wrong with your input.

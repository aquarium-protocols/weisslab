Yeast Mating
---
#### How it works?
For each yeast mating task, the yeast mating workflow takes two yeast strains as input and produces a mated yeast strain on a selective media plate. It automatically creates a new yeast strain in the database where the name of the new yeast strain is generated by concatenating two parent yeast strains' names. In detail, it uses glycerol stock from each yeast strain and inoculates each into 1 mL YPAD. Then mix them into 14 mL tube to incubate for at least 5 hrs. After incubation, it schedules a streak_yeast_plate protocol to streak the yeast on a selective media plate defined by the user from the task input. After 48 hrs, it schedules an image_plate protocol to image and store the plate.

#### Input requirements
| Argument name   |  Data type | Data structure | Inventory type | Sample property | Item required |
|:---------- |:------------- |:------------- |:------------- |:------------- |:------------- |
| yeast_mating_strain_ids  |  sample id | array with size 2 | Yeast Strain | Not required | Yeast Glycerol Stock |
| yeast_selective_plate_type  |  string | string | N/A | N/A | N/A |

yeast_selective_plate_type indicates which type of plate you intend to plate on for the mated strain, it's usually a combination of two markers, such as -TRP, -HIS or -URA, -LEU, etc.

LR Reaction
Use nanodrop to measure concentration of pEntry vectors, make 5 femtomolar working solution of each pEntry.
Combine into 1 aliquot:
•	1uL of 5 fmol of pENTR_L4_Promoter_R1
•	1uL of 5 fmol pENTR_L1_Gene_L2
•	1uL of 10 fmol pDEST_R4_R2
•	3uL Total
WARNING: KEEP ALIQUOTED LR CLONASE MIX AT -80 AT ALL TIMES!
Add 0.5uL LR Clonase Enzyme
Additionally, remember to mix your reactions well after all elements have been added (use a 10 uL pipette set to 3 or 4 uL, then just pipette up and down gently)
Leave at room temperature for minimum of 16 hours, maximum of 24 hours.
transform just 1 uL of the reaction (This should result in around 50-500 colonies (more often than not closer to 500) with high (~90-95%) efficiency)
or storage -20C freezer.


Transformation
Steps
1.	Make sure that the incubator (30/37C) and heat block (42C) are ON
2.	Make sure required antibiotic plates are present. Check the antibiotic resistance on the plasmid map in Vector NTI.
3.	Take the DNA out of --20 frig, let it thaw
4.	Make sure that all of the required reagents/DNA etc are present at the site of transformation before you take the cells out of the -80.
5.	Thaw the competent cells on ice for 7-8 min.
6.	Add 1.0 µl of DNA (about 10ng) into the liquid (Don’t vortex). Tap the sides of the tube to mix. If transforming multiple plasmids, add 10 ng of each.
7.	Incubate the cells on ice for 30 min
8.	Heat shock the cells for EXACTLY 30 sec at 42 C water bath.
9.	Place on ice for 2 min.
10.	Add 0.9ml of room temperature S.O.C medium to each tube (S.O.C is made by dissolving 0.5 ml of 20% glucose in 25 ml of SOB. Make sure that the SOC is clear and not cloudy/ contaminated.)
11.	Shake the tubes at 37 C, 280 rpm for 60 min or 30 C for 90 min
12.	Plate 20uL on one side of a plate
13.	Spin remaining cells at 5000rpm for 1 min, pour off supernatant, resuspend cells in remaining liquid (DO NOT vortex) and plate on other side of plate.
14.	Incubate plates upright for 20 min., then upside down overnight (12-14 h) at 37 C or 16-18h at 30C.
Can leave the cells in the incubator for up to 18 hours but no more.

Miniprep
Before you Start:
1.	Make sure provided RNase A solution has been added to Buffer P1 before use. One vial of RNase A per bottle of Buffer P1 to give final concentration of 100ug/mL. If you're the one adding, initial top and check box on cap!
2.	Buffer P1 will be in the fridge.
3.	Add ethanol to Buffer PE before use and then check mark on cap.
4.	Check Buffers P2 and N3 for precipitates, if any redissolve by placing in water bath at 37C Do NOT vortex.
5.	Add the provided LyseBlue reagent to Buffer P1 and mix before use. Use one vial LyseBlue per bottle of P1 to achieve 1:1000 dilution. If you're the one adding, initial top and check the box on cap.

Steps
1.	Transfer 1-5mL of overnight culture of plasmid cells into 2ml microcentrifuge collection tubes (1 per try) provided in the kit. Pellet for 1 min. Decant all the liquid and add 1 ml of the culture into the corresponding tube. Make sure not to mix up the tries.
2.	Resuspend pelleted cells in 250 uL Buffer P1 and transfer to microcentrifuge tube.
3.	Add 250uL Buffer P2 and mix thoroughly by inverting tube 4-6 times. Do NOT vortex. Mixture turns blue.
4.	Add 350uL of Buffer N3 and mix IMMEDIATELY by inverting tube 4-6 times. Do NOT vortex. Mixture is no longer blue.
5.	Centrifuge 10min at 13,000 rpm in table-top centrifuge.
6.	Apply the supernatant to a QIAprep spin column by decanting. Do NOT get any of the sticky precipitate.
7.	Centrifuge for 30 - 60s at 13000rpm. Discard flowthrough.
8.	Wash the QIAprep column by adding 0.5 mL Buffer PB.
9.	Centrifuge for 30 - 60s at 13000rpm. Discard flowthrough.
10.	Wash the QIAprep column by adding 0.75 mL Buffer PE.
11.	Centrifuge for 30 - 60s at 13000rpm. Discard flowthrough.
12.	Place the QIAprep column in a clean 1.5mL microcentrifuge tube. To elute DNA, add 50uL Buffer EB to center of each column. Be careful NOT to pierce column.
13.	Let stand for 1 minute.
14.	Centrifuge for 60s at 13000rpm.
15.	Remove column and discard, tube now contains DNA.
16.	Go to NanoDrop and spec DNA.

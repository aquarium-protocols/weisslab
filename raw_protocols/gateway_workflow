1.	In silico work by designer (Plan restriction digests, plan sequencing primers, make virtual sequence)
2.	Procure 3 tubes ENTRs, DESTs from -20 Freezer (assuming all exist)
3.	Pipette clonase, ENTRs, DESTs into strip tubes (4 reactants for each LR reaction, 1uL each)
4.	Incubate strip tubes for 4-16 hours at RT
5.	Procure comp cells from -80 Freezer
6.	Transform LRs, pipette steps w/ ice, heat-shock
7.	Outgrowth at 37C
8.	Plating and grown at 37C
9.	Pick colonies into liquid culture
10.	Grow at 37C
11.	Miniprep
12.	Set-up Digests in tube
13.	Incubate Digest
14.	Run Digest on Gel
15.	Restriction Analysis
16.	Send for Sequencing
17.	Sequence Alignment
18.	Organize samples, tubes, etc
